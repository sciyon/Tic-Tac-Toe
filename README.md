Tic-tac-toe Game

Instruction:

Using Xamarin.Forms, create a single page, simple 3x3 grid tic-tac-toe game.

High-level Specifications:

Player 1 is assigned to X while player 2 is assigned to O. It should have an indicator for the player's turn. Touch-move rule. Once a location is selected, it cannot be undone or changed. Most importantly, the game should determine and display the winner between player 1 or player 2. If the game is tied, nothing happens. Once there is a winner, all location will not be clickable unless game is restarted. Reset button is always present. Once clicked, the game restarts.

Technical Specifications:

Implement an interface for your game, especially the grid. Use your own creativity using what you have learned. No deduction for very simple UI as of the moment. Use only a single page (MainPage) You can use resources like images to improve the UI of your game.

Output:

You can zip your entire project folder or just upload a link of your project file (github/bitbucket)
